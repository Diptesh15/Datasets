Senthilnayaki B et al., conducted churn analysis using lazy leraning models. In
their implementation various algorithms like Logistic Algorithm, Random Forest
and KNN were included. They also compared the performance of the models through various aspects. They concluded
that there should be lesser number of the features to include in order to 
increase accuracy of the models and to obtain better performance.[1]

Khulood Ebrah et al., performed comprehensive analysis for predicting churn 
of the customers. In the implementation the model performance was measured
by Area Under Curve (AUC). They used two benchmark datasets viz., 
IBM Watson Dataset and cell2cell dataset. Varipous algorithms like Naive Bayes,
decisoin Tree, SVM were in used[2]

Muhamed Hassen Seid et al., done the churn predition for the customer for
Comercial Bank of Ethiopia. They use around 2 Lakhs of data rows along with 
about 11 attributes. Here, the SMOTE method was used in order  to balance the
unbalanced dataset. They achieved accuracy of 79.32% with percision of 85.08% 
followed by the recall of 78.19%[3]
